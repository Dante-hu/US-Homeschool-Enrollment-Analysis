Homeschool Enrollment Analysis in the U.S.
Overview
This project is a data science exploration of homeschool enrollment in the United States. We imported publicly available data on homeschool enrollment and applied various data science techniques to clean and analyze the data. The analysis was performed using Jupyter Notebook with Python, leveraging popular data science libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Project Structure
Data: Contains the raw data files used in the analysis.
Notebooks: Includes Jupyter Notebooks used for data cleaning and analysis.
Data_Cleaning.ipynb: Notebook detailing the data cleaning process.
Data_Analysis.ipynb: Notebook demonstrating the analysis of homeschool enrollment data.
Visualizations: Contains visualizations generated during the analysis.
