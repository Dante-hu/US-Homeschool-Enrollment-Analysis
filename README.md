# Homeschool Enrollment Analysis in the U.S.

## Overview

This project is a data science exploration of homeschool enrollment in the United States. We imported publicly available data on homeschool enrollment and applied various data science techniques to clean and analyze the data. The analysis was performed using Jupyter Notebook with Python, leveraging popular data science libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Project Structure

- **Data**: Contains the raw data files used in the analysis.
- **Notebooks**: Includes Jupyter Notebooks used for data cleaning and analysis.
  - `Data_Cleaning.ipynb`: Notebook detailing the data cleaning process.
  - `Data_Analysis.ipynb`: Notebook demonstrating the analysis of homeschool enrollment data.
- **Visualizations**: Contains visualizations generated during the analysis.
- **README.md**: This file providing an overview of the project.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `Notebooks` directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebooks (`Data_Cleaning.ipynb` and `Data_Analysis.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebooks to understand the data cleaning process and perform analysis.
5. Explore the visualizations in the `Visualizations` directory to gain insights into homeschool enrollment trends in the U.S.
